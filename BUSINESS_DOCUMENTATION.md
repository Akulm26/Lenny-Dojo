| Scattered resources across multiple platforms | Wasted preparation time |
| Difficulty simulating real interview pressure | Poor time management |
| No structured progression tracking | Unclear readiness |

### Lenny's Dojo Solution

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Generic questions | Questions from real company decisions |
| No feedback | AI coaching with dimensional feedback |
| Scattered resources | Centralized, curated content library |
| No pressure simulation | Timer modes for pressure simulation |
| No tracking | Comprehensive progress analytics |

### Market Opportunity

- **300,000+** product managers in the US
- **2-3 year** average tenure (continuous interview demand)
